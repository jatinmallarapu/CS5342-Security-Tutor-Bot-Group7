        "bot": "A Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) is an algorithm that uses a small amount of true randomness (called a \"seed\" or \"entropy\") to generate a large amount of output that appears random.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n*   **Purpose:** True randomness, derived from physical processes, is expensive and often impractical for software. PRNGs provide a computationally efficient way to produce random-looking numbers.\n*   **Mechanism:** They are deterministic, meaning the output is generated according to a set algorithm from the initial seed.\n*   **Security:** For an attacker who doesn't know the internal state or seed, the output of a cryptographically secure PRNG is computationally indistinguishable from truly random numbers.\n*   **Also known as:** Deterministic Random Bit Generators (DRBGs).\n\n**Sources:** data/pdfs/Lecture 9_slides.pdf, data/pdfs/Lecture 7_slides.pdf"

        "bot": "Kerberos is a **centralized authentication service** that provides **mutual authentication** between users (clients) and servers in an open, distributed environment.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n*   **Purpose:** It ensures that both the user and the server verify each other's identity, preventing unauthorized access and impersonation.\n*   **Mechanism:** It uses symmetric cryptography and relies on a trusted third party (the Kerberos Key Distribution Center or KDC) to issue \"tickets\" that prove identity and establish secure, short-term **session keys**.\n*   **Security:** Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping and replay attacks, ensuring secure communication even over insecure networks.\n*   **Key Idea:** Instead of repeatedly sending long-term secrets, Kerberos uses these secrets to derive shorter-term session keys for specific user-server interactions, making the process more secure and efficient.\n\n**Sources:** data/pdfs/Lecture 21_slides.pdf, data/pdfs/Lecture 23_slides.pdf"
