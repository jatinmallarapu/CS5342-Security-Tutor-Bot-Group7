        "bot": "Confidentiality, in network security, is a fundamental principle that ensures **private or sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals**.\n\nIt encompasses:\n*   **Data confidentiality:** Guaranteeing that only authorized users or systems can access specific data.\n*   **Privacy:** Giving individuals control over what information related to them is collected, stored, and disclosed, and to whom.\n\nThink of it like keeping student grade information secure \u2013 only the student, their parents (if authorized), and the relevant faculty/administration should be able to view it.\n\n**Sources:** data/pdfs/Lecture 1_slides.pdf"

        "bot": "Kerberos is a **network authentication protocol** that provides **strong authentication** for client/server applications in a distributed environment. Its main goal is to allow users to prove their identity to network services over an insecure network without repeatedly sending their password.\n\nHere's what it aims to achieve:\n*   **Secure Authentication:** Ensures both the client and the server can verify each other's identity securely.\n*   **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Users authenticate once to Kerberos and then receive \"tickets\" that grant them access to various network services without needing to re-enter their credentials.\n*   **Protection against Eavesdropping:** It prevents passwords from being sent across the network, mitigating the risk of them being intercepted.\n\n**How it works (Simply put):**\nInstead of sending your password to every service you want to access, Kerberos uses a trusted third party called the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**.\n1.  You authenticate to the KDC (often with your password) once.\n2.  The KDC then issues you secure, encrypted **\"tickets\"**.\n3.  You present these tickets to the specific network services you wish to use, and the service grants you access because it trusts the ticket issued by the KDC.\n\nThink of it like a secure, digital passport office: you prove your identity once to get a special pass, and then you use that pass to get entry visas for different countries (network services) without showing your original passport at every border.\n\n**Sources:** data/pdfs/Lecture 4_slides.pdf\n\n**Sources:** data/pdfs/Lecture 23_slides.pdf, data/pdfs/Lecture 21_slides.pdf"
