Authentication to confirm users' identities, preventing unauthorized access by verifying credentials such as usernames or biometric characteristics (as per both lecture slides mentioned above).\n\n4. Non-repudiation prevents any party from denying the authenticity of their communication, ensuring actions like financial transactions cannot be denied later on which is crucial for legal and compliance reasons (from Lecture 3_slides PDF).\n\n5.

Network security aims to protect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability within computer networks by implementing various controls at different layers of the OSI model (e.g., firewalls for packet filtering).\n2. It uses cryptographic methods such as SSL/TLS encryption and digital signatures to secure communication channels against eavesdropping or tampering attacks like man-in-the-middle, ensuring data confidentiality during transmission. \n3. Effective access control policies are vital for network security; they define who has permission to interact with various resources within the system using authentication protocols (e.g., passwords, biometrics) and authorization mechanisms that limit user privileges based on roles or attributes.\n4. Regularly updating systems is a key aspect of maintaining robust network defenses as it patches vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers in attempts to gain unautpersonal access (e.g., buffer overflow attacks). \n5. Network security also encompasses proactive monitoring and auditing practices such as intrusion detection systems, which continuously scan the network for suspicious activities indicative of a cyberattack or policy violation allowing timely intervention before damage occurs."
